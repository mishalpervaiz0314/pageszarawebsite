        <p class="text-lg-start p-p">What is Wellness Chiropractic?</p>

        <p class="text-lg-start car-p">More often than not, when we tell someone that we are
            a chiropractic office, they immediately associate our vocation with neck and/or
            back pain. What many do not realize, however, is that chiropractic is a health
            care modality that provides significantly more than just a solution for pain.
            Chiropractic is a lifestyle that involves all aspects of wellness,
            including exercise, nutrition, personal development, and stress relief.
            We have been fortunate to work with people from all walks of life
            (including newborns, children, and adolescents) and the outcome has been miraculous.</p>

        <img src="/img/CHIROPRACTIC1 (1).png" class="img-fluid last" alt="...">

        <p class="text-lg-start car-p">Chiropractors use hands-on spinal manipulation,
            trigger-point therapy, electronic stimulation, and other treatments to
            bring the vertebrae in your neck and into proper alignment.
            By clearing blockage in nerve cells, restoring mobility to joints,
            and easing pain and muscle tension, chiropractic treatment
            allows your body to heal itself without surgery or medication.</p>

        <div class="row">
            <div class="col">

                <p class="text-lg-start c-t">1. Less pain.</p>

                <p class="text-md-start"> Many people suffer from chronic back or neck pain.
                    Pain relievers can provide temporary relief, but they do nothing to fix the problem.
                    Chiropractic adjustments address the origin of the pain.</p>

                    <p class="text-lg-start c-t">2. Better posture.</p>
                
                    <p class="text-md-start">If you’re doing desk work, you’re likely sitting down for 
                        longer periods than our bodies were designed for. Sitting in front of a computer for
                         hours often leads to slumping and bad posture, which in turn puts a lot of extra
                          pressure on our neck, shoulders, and hips. Regular chiropractic care can put your
                           spine back into alignment.</p>

                           <p class="text-lg-start c-t">3. Fewer headaches.</p>
                
                           <p class="text-md-start">Roughly nine out of 10 Americans suffer from headaches.
                             Since most headaches are linked to muscle tension in the neck, spinal 
                             manipulation and other chiropractic techniques can often effectively reduce headache pain.</p>

            <p class="text-lg-start c-t">4. Less pain.</p>

            <p class="text-md-start"> To fight off infections and disease, our immune system relies on messages
                 being sent correctly through our nerves. When vertebrae go out of alignment, they can pinch a nerve, 
                 potentially blocking these messages. Regular chiropractic wellness care can relieve the pressure on 
                 the nerve and allow the immune system to work at peak efficiency.</p>

                <p class="text-lg-start c-t">5. Better posture.</p>
            
                <p class="text-md-start">Because chiropractic care can relieve many types of pain without surgery,
                     it can significantly reduce a person’s reliance on drugs. In fact, an estimated 96% of people with 
                     chronic back pain can be treated non-surgically.</p>

                       <p class="text-lg-start c-t">6. Fewer headaches.</p>
            
                       <p class="text-md-start">Traditionally, mood swings or depression have been treated with medication.
                         However, that route can be expensive and may still carry a social stigma. Chiropractic adjustments
                          improve the nervous system, which can repair the chemical imbalance that often leads to mood swings.
                           By clearing obstacles in our nerves, chiropractic care can also help us think more clearly..</p>
